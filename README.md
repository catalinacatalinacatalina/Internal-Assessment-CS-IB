## Welcome to Keep The Ball Flying!

This project was my Internal Assessment for the Computer Science High Level subject of the International Baccalaureate. Everything you'll find here is my own creation. Feel free to explore and use any aspect you'd like.

## Description
Keep The Ball Flying is a desktop application developed with Processing 4, designed to facilitate the work of volleyball team coaches. Connected to a database, this application provides various functionalities to enhance team management and training.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Screens**: The application features several screens, including a virtual whiteboard for designing tactics, a table for viewing player information, and a log of saved plays for analysis and future reference.
- **Database Connection**: The application is connected to a local database using MySQLWorkbench.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The application utilizes all aspects of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- **Six-versioned**: You will see there are six versions of the application, use the most recent, the others are made just to see progress.

## Additional Information
- **Development Time**: The development process of Keep The Ball Flying has taken almost a year, during which I worked on implementing features, designing the user interface, and solving technical issues.
- **Language(s)**: You'll see there are many languages in this project, that's totally my fault (i've mixed spanish, catalan and english)
- **Documentation**: Currently, documentation for the project is missing, but it will soon be completed and uploaded to facilitate its understanding and use by other users.
  
    > As one of my early projects developed as an unexperienced teenager, there might be some flaws or areas for improvement. Please keep this in mind while exploring the application.



I hope you enjoy exploring Keep The Ball Flying as much as I enjoyed developing it! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
