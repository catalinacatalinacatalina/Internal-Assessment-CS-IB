# Keep The Ball Flying
## Welcome to Keep The Ball Flying!

This project was originally developed in **2022** as my Internal Assessment for the Computer Science Higher Level subject of the **International Baccalaureate**. Everything you'll find here is my own original work — feel free to explore, help, use and get inspired by any part of it.



## 🏐 Description

**Keep The Ball Flying** is a desktop application built with **Processing 4**, designed to assist **volleyball team coaches** in managing their teams more effectively. Initially connected to a **MySQL database**, the application provided tools for planning, visualizing tactics, and managing player data.


## ✨ Key Features

- **Multiple Screens**: Includes a **virtual whiteboard** for designing tactics, a **player info table**, and a **logbook** for saved plays.
- **Database Support**:
  - 🕰️ **Version 6 and below** used a **MySQL database** (via MySQL Workbench).
  - 🔄 **From now on**, the database is being migrated to a **local `.db` (SQLite)** file for easier access and portability.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Fully embraces **OOP principles** — encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism — for clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Six Versions**: There are six historical versions of the app. **Version 6** is the one submitted to the International Baccalaureate. Use the **most recent version** if you want a stable legacy reference, or follow the **new development branch** for future updates.



## 🛠️ Project Evolution (2025 Onward)

> As of **2025**, *Keep The Ball Flying* is no longer just an academic project — it is now being transformed into an **open-source project**.

- 📖 This repository is now **public**.
- 🧠 I'm using this project as a **sandbox for personal and professional growth**.
- 🧩 Expect structural changes, feature redesigns, and experiments.
- 🧪 **Contributions**, suggestions, or constructive criticism are always welcome!



## 📝 Documentation

The documentation includes **12 PDF files** explaining both the development process and the functioning of the application, including design decisions and usage instructions.  

> **Note**: Criterion E is not included due to file size, but you can view it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zbyCVkEzI179xp--qM2RgnEFgVsGidk/view?usp=drive_link).



## 🌐 Languages

Yes, the code and documentation may contain **Spanish**, **Catalan**, and **English** — my bad! This was one of my first serious projects, and I didn’t yet have a clear standard. Expect some multilingual moments!


## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### ✅ Requirements

- You need to have **Processing 5** installed and properly set up in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**.  
  👉 [Follow this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuu-WcOZYA) to install and configure it.

### ▶️ Running the App in VSCode

Once you have everything ready, open a terminal and run:

```bash
processing-java --sketch="your-absolute-path/Internal-Assessment-CS-IB/v07" --run
```

🔁 Replace "your-absolute-path" with the actual full path where you’ve saved the project on your machine.

🧪 Note: As development continues, the folder name may change from v07 to a new version or branch reflecting ongoing improvements with SQLite integration.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This was developed when I was still a very inexperienced (but passionate) teenager.  
So if you spot some clunky code or bad practices — you're probably right.  
But that’s exactly why I’m coming back to it now ❤️


## 🙌 Final Note

I hope you enjoy exploring *Keep The Ball Flying* as much as I enjoyed building (and rebuilding) it.  
If you have questions, want to collaborate, or just want to say hi — feel free to reach out!
